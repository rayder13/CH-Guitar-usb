## Fret Buttons

This is my first prototype for fret buttons to suit the WoR guitar fretboard. The initial print is pretty close to the original, or at least as close as i'm going to get with an FDM printer. Testing with the low profile Kailh switches says the fret buttons need an extra 5mm or so clearance so a modified fret button file will have to be made to accommodate that. But for now I mostly needed a confirmation of fit so that people can print them for themselves if they want.

All available STL's are in the [3D Print Files folder](../hardware/3d%20Print%20Files)
