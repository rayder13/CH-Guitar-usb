DIY Clone Hero Guitar

::TBAProjectName:: is a DIY full replacement for the oem electronics in a Warriors of Rock Playstation/Xbox Guitar Hero guitar. The result is a wired, Clone Hero compatible guitar. I will possibly be adding custom Fret key files, other 3d printable mounting options (For control board etc) and maybe new body variations that work with the original WoR body.

# Progress

Fretboard
- Prototype pcb done and ordered. The pcb will use Kailh Choc low profile switches instead of the oem rubber membrane keys. This should fix sloppy fret keys and allow for a better feel depending on your preferences with tactile, clicky and linear keys available in the low profile switches.
- Potential to add led's to each switch for either all on lighting while connected or having the fret light up when pressed.
    
D-Pad
- Prototypre pcb done and ordered. Utilising the original rubber membrane pad given how little the keys get used.
- Swapping to mechanical keys might not be easy given the confinement of space.

Strummer
- Prototype pcb in progress. Waiting for Kailh Chic low profile switches to show up to decide whether to use them, MX Cherry blacks or Alps keys.

Start/Star Power
- Prototype pcb in progress. Will likely use Kailh Choc low profile switches as well. 

Arduino Controller
- Full working prototype was made on an Arduino Leonardo board. Custom board based on the ATMEGA34U2 mcu will be prototyped after all of the other pcb's are verified working as intended. A full pin hookup guild will be added on full release for anyone who wants to use an existing ATMEGA34U2 board (Arduino pro micro etc) as main controller board.
